                        What does the data tell us about Kenyan’s education system in 2014? It is readily apparent that
                        the ratio of boys to
                        girls attending school is generally weighted slightly higher toward boys. Furthermore, the data
                        consistently shows that
                        school attendance from first grade through eighth grade drops dramatically across all counties.
                        For example, Turkana
                        County in northwestern Kenya shows the attendance of 22,406 girls and 26,444 boys in first
                        grade, but only 3,175 girls
                        and 5,031 boys in eighth grade—which is a difference of <span class="red-bold">86%</span> for
                        girls and <span class="red-bold">81%</span> for boys. Though each grade level in the 2014
                        snapshot
                        belongs to different cohorts, following the data from one cohort from first through eighth-grade
                        results in a similar pattern.
                    <p>
                        Compared to European or East Asian standards, Kenya’s education system lags far behind
                        in quality and
                        outcome.
                        However, in 2017, the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked Kenya the <a
                            href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/africa-jobs-skills-in-charts/">highest in
                            Africa</a> for overall
                        quality of education. The WEF’s <a
                            href="https://reports.weforum.org/human-capital-report-2016/">Human Capital
                            Index</a> is a metric that attempts to quantify the level at which countries optimise the
                        workforce by taking
                        into account parameters such as education, age, available work, etc. The WEF ranked Africa at
                        55% compared to the
                        global average of
                        65%—with Kenya rated within the top 10 Sub-Saharan countries at a rate of 57.8%. The WEF ranked
                        Kenya 102 out of the
                        130
                        countries worldwide.</p>

                <div class="indented">
                    <p>Why link education to the WEF’s Human Capital Index? We’ll explore this connection further, but
                        first, let’s look
                        at
                        the
                        opening paragraph of an article published in <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>
                        titled <a

                            Kenya Became the Strongest Education System in Africa”</a> below:

                        cite="https://medium.com/edwell/how-kenya-became-the-strongest-education-system-in-africa-70cdc72024c4">
                        “In 2017, the World Economic Forum rated Kenya’s education system as the strongest on the
                        African continent. In
                        2018,
                        the World Bank ranked Kenya the top African country for education outcomes (1st out of 43
                        mainland countries).
                        In
                        2019, a Kenyan was named the most outstanding teacher in the world and awarded a prestigious $1
                        million prize.”
                    </blockquote>
                    Sounds fantastic, right? The article goes into further detail, expanding these ideas. However,
                    getting the
                    perspective of someone other than a Western Journalist brings a different perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p> Jonathan Mburugu is from Kenya and is the founder of <a
                            href="https://schoolforafrica.org/">SchoolForAfrica.org</a>. His experiences and struggles,
                        first as a
                        student and later as a teacher and advocate for Kenyan schoolchildren, paints a much different
                        picture. He
                        describes the issues of national-level economic conditions and individual financial limitations
                        as the major
                        contributing factors facing the education system in Kenya. In particular, Mburugu explains that
                        even though
                        primary school education in Kenya is both <a
                            href="https://schoolforafrica.org/education/education-and-system-of-education-in-kenya/">compulsory
                            and
                            free</a>, the government only pays for tuition—other expenses such as books and food are not
                        covered.
                        Furthermore, <a
                            href="https://africacheck.org/fact-checks/factsheets/factsheet-cost-providing-truly-free-secondary-education-kenya#:~:text=So%20the%20vision%20of%20a,basic%20education%20and%20related%20expenditure.">challenges
                            in Kenya’s education system</a> extend into secondary and beyond.</p>
                    <p>
                        The individual effort and hard work of Jonathan Mburugu brought him to where he is today. He
                        continues to
                        advocate for Kenya’s schoolchildren and hopes to further expand his educational initiatives to
                        neighbouring
                        African countries. Mburugu is right by highlighting financial issues as the cause of many of
                        Kenya’s educational
                        woes. Mburugu’s approach to solving these issues is also correct—that African problems must
                        be solved from within Africa itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>Clearly, Mburugu is an intelligent, hard-working, and motivated individual, and a man of his
                        calibre is often well-positioned
                        to relocate to ‘greener pastures’ in Europe or the United States. Educated Africans,
                        especially those that have studied abroad, often do not return to their home countries as it is
                        easier to attain a better life by living as expatriates. The ramifications this
                        so-called “brain drain” has on African countries is that they lose their best and brightest
                        individuals which causes compounding disadvantages in economic, scientific, and social development.
                        This phenomenon has been
                        studied in-depth at various organisations such as the <a
                            href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/brain-drain-africa-state-the-issue-and-possible-solutions">Wilson

                            Foundation</a>.
                        These two organisations, as well as many others, agree on the best course of action: Africa
                        needs to not only curb but also reverse the
                        migration and brain drain in order to strive toward a more prosperous future. At a <a

                        “Even insects migrate from where it is dark to where there is light. No wonder Africa’s youth –
                        our assets –
                        take huge risks migrating to Europe, looking for a better life. The future of Africa’s youth
                        does not lie in
                        migration to Europe; it should not be at the bottom of the Mediterranean; it lies in a
                        prosperous Africa. We
                        must create greater economic opportunities for our youth right at home in Africa.”</blockquote>

                    An artist, scientist, bibliophile, and autodidact at heart, Sirius enjoys applying these
                    facets in his role of dad and husband first and foremost. He also finds happiness with
                    spending time with <a class="dotted-underline">Shin'yū the Maltipoo<span><img
                                src="site-data/graphics/shin-yu.jpg" alt="Fluffy Little Dog"></span></a>
                    (Shin'yū or 親友 is the Japanese term for "best friend"). Sirius also enjoys calligraphy,
                    metacognition, philosophy, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge regardless of the path it
                    puts him on. He generally prefers Open Source Software solutions such as FreeBSD for daily
                    computing, QGIS for cartography and geospatial analysis, GIMP and Inkscape for image
                    manipulation. However, he is no stranger to proprietary solutions such as ArcGIS Pro, Adobe
                    Photoshop and Illustrator.
